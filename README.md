# Curriculum-Design-Recommender
Data science, analytics, AI, big data are becoming widely used in many fields, that leads to the ever-increasing demand of data analysts, data scientists and other data professionals. Due to that, data science education is now a hot topic for educators and entrepreneurs. The objectives of this project are to redesign the curriculum of MIE1624: Intro to Data Science and Analytics and redesign a curriculum for a new “Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence” program at University of Toronto. The program will focus on both techinical and business skills. Lastly, we will design an online course delivery system that automatically adapts to learning patterns of an individual student and automatically adjusts a sequence of slides in online course for her/him.
